This is a configuration starter for **Marlin 1.1.9** on the **Anet A4** Delta 3d printer.

## Adjusting for your printer
* _DELTA_DIAGONAL_ROD_ should be set to the length of your rods.
    * If your parts turn out larger or smaller than expected then this should be increased or decreased respectively

* _DELTA_RADIUS_ should be adjusted if your nozzle doesn't navigate from the center to the outside in a flat line

    * If the nozzle is too high in the center an goes towards the bed increase delta radius
    * If the nozzle is too low in the center and goes away from the bed decrease the delta radius
